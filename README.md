The aim of the March 2021 Hackathon with the Code Institute was based around hacking St Patrick's Day.



St Patrick's Day is coming up, but it is going to be very different this year. We were tasked with coming up with a website, app or other web-based idea that would help people celebrate St Patrick's day together during lockdown.



In true lockdown style, what better way to celebrate St Patrick's Day than partaking in our new favorite thing to do... A QUIZ!



But this is no ordinary quiz. It's a St Patrick's Day themed quiz!
